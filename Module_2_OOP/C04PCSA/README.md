# Primavera Academy | ReStart 6 | Module 2 - OOP

## Programming C# - Advanced

This project intends to record all classes from Promavera Academy's course ReStart, 6<sup>th</sup> edition, _Programming C# - Advanced_.

It is composed by several C# projects.

### D00_Utils

Utility project, which has static methods that might be useful to other projects. 

### D01_OOP_Encapsulation

This project is a basic and simple example of how to use **encapsulation** in C#.

### D02_OOP_Inheritance

This project is a basic and simple example of how to use **inheritance** in C#.

### D03_OOP_Polymorphism

This project is a basic and simple example of how to use **polymorphism** in C#.

### D04_OOP_Abstraction

This project is a basic and simple example of how to use **absatraction** in C#.

### D05_OOP_Interfaces

This project is a basic and simple example of how to use **interfaces** in C#.

### E01_Calculator

Exercise to practice OOP.

Apply OOP principles:

1. Create a Class Calculator, which can not be instantiated
2. All its members must be implemented in the derived classes
3. All calculators must execute the 4 aritmetic operations: Sum, Subtract, Multiply and Divide
4. From base class, derive classes CalculatorStandard and CalculatorScientific
5. CalculatorStandard class can Sum 2 or 3 values
6. CalculatorStandard class has a static method to round values to a given decimal, provided by the user
7. CalculatorScientific class adds the method GetSquareRoot
8. CalculatorScientific class has the static method GetDivisionMod
